# Project Overview
# Introduction

- This is an attempt to practice my Power BI skills by trying to see the current job market in 3 sectors **Public Sector**, **Private Sector**, and **Self-employed**
- In general, the data does show an increase in all 3 of the sectors but they are not that noticeable in bigger picture.
- All the data are from Stat Can, it has been verified and cleaned before the visualization starts.
# Technology Uses

- Data cleaning: Excel, Power BI
- Data Visualize: Power BI

# Data Sources

- Stat Can: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410028802
- Data format:  Structured Format (Excel, SQL)

# Key Insights

- **Public Sector vs Private Sector** The public sector is actively hiring but is constraint by budget issues while the private sector is hiring but not as much in order to preserve more revenue and also could be the demand is not there. 
- **Public Employed Worker** Shows a noticeable increase in 1 year but still has a lower number of employed workers in the public sector, which could be because the budget is insufficient to increase the number of workers they could employ.
- **Private Employed Worker** The data does show that private companies do hire workers but it's not noticeable, they have the lowest ratio in terms of hiring in a year compared to the public sector, which has the highest ratio, this could be because the economy of Canada is still recovering after the CoVid pandemic, and private sector are trying to lower how much they 
need to spent. 
- **Changes in a year** All of the sector from **Public Employed Workers** to **Self-employed** have an increase in the number of workers from 2023 to 2024 but the ratio that the workers got the job are still not noticeable.

# Reccommend solution

- The Canadian Government needs to invest in more infrastructure projects in order to attract more investors into the country so that more jobs can be created
- Temporary reduce HST/GST tax to encourage people to spend more
- Remove tax that doesn't do anything and cause more constraint to businesses
- Support more startups and small companies to encourage them to hire more employees
